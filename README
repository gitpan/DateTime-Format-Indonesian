    Parse an Indonesian string. Return undef if $str cannot be parsed.

TODO
    *   Recognize more forms

        Try to guess whether 01/02/99 is d/m/y or m/d/y (check if the other
        one is impossible; default to d/m/y but if sees lots of other m/d/y
        then m/d/y).

         mmm-dd-yy[yy]

    *   Autocorrect typo [#E]
